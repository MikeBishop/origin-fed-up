--- abstract

The definition of the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame "relaxes" the requirement to check DNS
for various reasons.  However, experience has shown that such relaxation leads
to security risks and is inadvisable.  This document restores the original
requirements.

# Introduction

{{!ORIGIN=RFC8336}} describes a method whereby an HTTP/2 server can enumerate
the HTTP origins for which it purports to be authoritative.  This set can be
greater or lesser than the set of origins over which the client might originally
have considered the server to be authoritative.  Of course, the client will
generally not send requests to a server unless it considers the server to be
authoritative for that origin.

Section 2.4 of {{!ORIGIN}} states that:

> ...clients "MAY avoid consulting DNS to establish the connection's authority for
> new requests to origins in the Origin Set; however, those that do so face new
> risks, as explained in Section 4.

In Section 4 of {{!ORIGIN}}, the attacks this enables are described, along with
the note that "Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be
vulnerable to a large number of attacks.  See Section 2.4 for mitigations."

The mitigation recommended in Section 2.4 is to require the use of TLS and that
the certificate presented be authoritative for the origin in question; the
latter is a requirement already present in {{!HTTP2=RFC7540}} for HTTP/2
connections using TLS.  In Section 4, it is further recommended that:

> ...clients opting not to consult DNS ought to employ some alternative means to
> establish a high degree of confidence that the certificate is legitimate.

Several methods of increasing certificate trust are referenced. However, during
the discussion of {{?SecondaryCerts=I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2-secondary-certs}},
the ability to perform attacks using a misissued or compromised certificate has
been a concern. These attacks are fundamentally enabled by the relaxation of the
requirement to verify DNS ownership, and ongoing community concern about these
attacks demonstrates that there is no longer consensus that these checks do not
serve a purpose.

# Some Alternative Means

{{ORIGIN}} leaves open-ended the decision of when to consider the certificate alone
sufficient to trust a server's claim of authority over an origin.  However, it enumerates
some possibilities:

> For example, clients might skip consulting DNS only if they receive proof of
> inclusion in a Certificate Transparency log {{?RFC6962}} or if they have a
> recent Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response {{?RFC6960}}
> (possibly using the "status_request" TLS extension {{?RFC6066}}) showing that
> the certificate was not revoked.

These mitigations are assuredly helpful in assuring general certificate validity, but
they fail to fully prevent attacks from misissued or compromised certificates.

## Certificate Transparency {#ct}

Certificate Transparency {{?RFC6962}} defines an experimental protocol for
publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as
they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certificate
authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well
as to audit the certificate logs themselves.

The expectation is that domain owners (or agents acting on their behalf) would
actively monitor such logs for domains they control, verify that any
newly-issued certificates are in fact legitimate, and have the certificate
revoked if not.

This does significantly reduce the odds of a misissued certificate having a long
usable lifetime. However, it does not reduce that lifetime to zero.  A Signed
Certificate Timestamp is not proof of inclusion in a Certificate Transparency
log -- it is a promise to include a certificate in a future log. Verification of
certificate inclusion requires having a Signed Tree Head from that CT log which
is newer than the SCT by at least that log's "maximum merge delay."
[CertificateTransparency]  A misissued certificate remains invisible to
inspecting parties for up to this period of time, plus whatever time is required
to detect the certificate after inclusion.  The "maximum merge delay" of most CT
logs is twenty-four hours. [GoogleTrustedCT] [AppleTrustedCT]

Revocation checking has been a known challenge for TLS clients, with OCSP Stapling
emerging as the solution of choice.  The server

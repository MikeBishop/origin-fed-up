--- abstract

The definition of the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame "relaxes" the requirement to check DNS
for various reasons.  However, experience has shown that such relaxation leads
to security risks and is inadvisable.  This document restores the original
requirements.

# Introduction

{{!ORIGIN=RFC8336}} describes a method whereby an HTTP/2 server can enumerate
the HTTP origins for which it purports to be authoritative.  This set can be
greater or lesser than the set of origins over which the client might originally
have considered the server to be authoritative.  Of course, the client will
generally not send requests to a server unless it considers the server to be
authoritative for that origin.

Section 2.4 of {{!ORIGIN}} states that:

> ...clients "MAY avoid consulting DNS to establish the connection's authority for
> new requests to origins in the Origin Set; however, those that do so face new
> risks, as explained in Section 4.

In Section 4 of {{!ORIGIN}}, the attacks this enables are described, along with
the note that "Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be
vulnerable to a large number of attacks.  See Section 2.4 for mitigations."

The mitigation recommended in Section 2.4 is to require the use of TLS and that
the certificate presented be authoritative for the origin in question; the
latter is a requirement already present in {{!HTTP2=RFC7540}} for HTTP/2
connections using TLS.  In Section 4, it is further recommended that:

> ...clients opting not to consult DNS ought to employ some alternative means to
> establish a high degree of confidence that the certificate is legitimate.

Several methods of increasing certificate trust are referenced. However, during
the discussion of {{?SecondaryCerts=I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2-secondary-certs}},
the ability to perform attacks using a misissued or compromised certificate has
been a concern. These attacks are fundamentally enabled by the relaxation of the
requirement to verify DNS ownership, and ongoing community concern about these
attacks demonstrates that there is no longer consensus that these checks do not
serve a purpose.

# Some Alternative Means

{{ORIGIN}} leaves open-ended the decision of when to consider the certificate alone
sufficient to trust a server's claim of authority over an origin.  However, it enumerates
some possibilities:

> For example, clients might skip consulting DNS only if they receive proof of
> inclusion in a Certificate Transparency log {{?RFC6962}} or if they have a
> recent Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response {{?RFC6960}}
> (possibly using the "status_request" TLS extension {{?RFC6066}}) showing that
> the certificate was not revoked.

These mitigations are assuredly helpful in assuring general certificate
validity, but they fail to fully prevent attacks from misissued or compromised
certificates.  In particular, a certificate which is fraudulently obtained or
compromised can remain usable by an attacker for nearly two weeks.

## Certificate Transparency {#ct}

Certificate Transparency {{?RFC6962}} defines an experimental protocol for
publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as
they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certificate
authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well
as to audit the certificate logs themselves.

The expectation is that domain owners (or agents acting on their behalf) would
actively monitor such logs for domains they control, verify that any
newly-issued certificates are in fact legitimate, and have the certificate
revoked if not.

This does significantly reduce the odds of a misissued certificate having a long
usable lifetime. However, it does not reduce that lifetime to zero.  A Signed
Certificate Timestamp is not proof of inclusion in a Certificate Transparency
log -- it is a promise to include a certificate in a future log. Verification of
certificate inclusion requires having a Signed Tree Head from that CT log which
is newer than the SCT by at least that log's "maximum merge delay."
[CertificateTransparency]  A misissued certificate remains invisible to
inspecting parties for up to this period of time, plus whatever time is required
to detect the certificate after inclusion.  The "maximum merge delay" of most CT
logs is twenty-four hours. (See [GoogleTrustedCT], [AppleTrustedCT].)

## OCSP

Revocation checking has been a known challenge for TLS clients, with OCSP
Stapling emerging as the solution of choice.  While an OCSP endpoint can often
be blocked by an attacker or otherwise be unavailable, the `status_request` TLS
extension {{?RFC6066}} can enable a client to request and the server to provide
a recent OCSP response as part of the TLS handshake.  This assists in verifying
the non-revoked state of the certificate without creating a single point of
failure.

However, the timeline for a revoked certificate still permits a surprising
period of exercise, as described in [CABForum]:

- CAs have up to 24 hours to revoke a compromised certificate after
  notification; longer for other reasons
- Certificate Revocation Lists and OCSP responses have a maximum validity period
  of ten days

This means that an attacker-held certificate remains potentially valid for use
by an attacker for as long as eleven days following the discovery of a
compromise or misissuance, plus any amount of time required to discover the
situation.

# Balancing Privacy and Defense

One reason for avoiding the DNS resolution was the fact that DNS is typically
performed over clear-text. In addition to the origin itself, other parties learn
that the client is interested in contacting the origin:

- The DNS server operator
- The client's Internet Service Provider
- Other clients which can observe local network traffic

By avoiding a DNS resolution for an origin, clients can avoid these parties
gaining additional information.  However, as described in this draft, doing
so exposes clients to different security concerns.

## Improving Privacy

Given recent developments such as DNS over TLS {{!DoT=RFC7858}} and DNS over
HTTPS {{!DoH=RFC8484}}, there are now alternative means to avoid disclosure of a
client's DNS activities to anyone other than the DNS server operator.

{{!DoT}} or {{!DoH}} SHOULD be used for DNS resolution when available in order
to limit unnecessary disclosure of a client's DNS activity to third parties.

## Limiting Scope of Certificate Compromise

In order to successfully use a fraudulent certificate, an attacker needs
one of the following situations to occur:

- The attacker controls the client's DNS resolution and can provide its
  own IP address as that of the victim domain.
- The attacker controls the path between the client and the victim domain's real
  address, and can hijack a TCP connection intended for the victim domain's
  server
- The fraudulent certificate contains both the victim domain and an
  attacker-controlled domain, and the attacker can induce the client to access
  the attacker-owned domain
- The client supports {{?SecondaryCerts}}, and the attacker can induce the
  client to access the attacker-owned domain

Following the DNS verifications in {{!HTTP2}}, only the first two situations
will result in the client considering the attacker authoritative for the victim
domain.  However, if the client relaxes DNS checks as specified in {{!ORIGIN}},
the latter two attack configurations become possible as well.

As a result, DNS resolution MUST continue to be performed prior to accepting a
server as valid for an HTTP origin.


## Updates to RFC 8336

{{!ORIGIN}} is modified as follows:

- The fifth paragraph of Section 2.4 is deleted
- The first three paragraphs of Section 4 are replaced with the contents of
  {{security}} from this document

# Security Considerations {#security}

Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be vulnerable to a
large number of attacks.

Omitting the requirement to consult DNS when determining authority for an origin
would mean that an attacker who possesses a valid certificate no longer needs to be
on path to redirect traffic to them; instead of modifying DNS, they need only
convince the user to visit another website in order to coalesce connections to
the target onto their existing connection.

Before considering a server to be authoritative for any given origin, clients
MUST validate that the destination IP address is valid for the origin either by
direct DNS resolution or resolution of a validated Alternative Service
{{!AltSvc=RFC7838}}.
